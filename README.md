# CodeJam - SAP Cloud Application Programming Model - Node.js

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-nodejs-codejam)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-nodejs-codejam)

## Description

This repository contains the material for the CodeJam on SAP Cloud Application Programming Model with Node.js. Prerequisites and recommendations for this CodeJam are documented in the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) file.

### CodeJam overview

The focus of this CodeJam is the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model ("CAP" for short) with Node.js. Through a series of developer focused hands-on exercises you'll get to know the CAP related tools, create a CAP project and learn about various aspects such as compilation, persistence, OData operations, data models & service definitions and how they relate, and dig into annotations, custom logic and debugging. You'll also add a user interface (UI) layer, and see how the entire set of artifacts can be deployed to the SAP Cloud Platform.

### Material organization

The material consists of a series of exercises that are to be done in order (each one building on the previous one). Each exercise is contained in a directory, with a main 'readme' file containing the core exercise instructions, with optional supporting files, such as screenshots and sample files.

### Following the exercises

Except for some of the content in exercise 09, we strongly recommend you avoid copy/pasting content - there isn't much to type in all, and learning works better when it starts with osmosis through the fingertips! Everything you need to enter will be described in each of the exercise 'readme' files.

At the end of each exercise there are questions. These questions are designed to help you think about the content just covered, and are to be discussed with the entire CodeJam class, at the end of each exercise. If you finish an exercise early, please resist the temptation to continue with the next one. Instead, explore what you've just done and see if you can find out more about the subject that was covered. That way we all stay on track together and can benefit from some reflection via the questions (and answers).

:point_right: Where there's an action for you to perform, it will be prefixed with this pointing symbol, to help you focus on where you are in each exercise.
