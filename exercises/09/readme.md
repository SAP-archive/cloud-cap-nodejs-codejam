# Exercise 09 - Introducing an app at the UI layer

In this exercise you'll add a UI layer, by adding annotations that can drive aspects of a user interface (UI), and introducing a Fiori Elements based app.


## Steps

Following these steps, you'll build a simple Fiori app that sits in a local Fiori launchpad environment, and that serves up book details from the `CatalogService` OData service, helped by annotations that you'll be specifying.


### 1. Introduce a basic HTML page to be served for the UI

Following the "convention over configuation" theme, the Node.js flavored CAP model will also automatically serve static resources (such as UI artefacts) from a directory called `app/`. 

If there isn't anything that can be sensibly served in the `app/` directory it will serve the "Welcome to cds.services" landing page we've seen already:

![the "Welcome to cds.services" landing page](../07/two-services.png)

:point_right: Create an `app/` directory, at the same level as the `db/` and `srv/` directories. This directory that will contain the app files.


:point_right: Create the `webapp/` directory as a child of the `app/` and create an `index.html` file within it, containing the following.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>

    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8" />
    <title>Bookshop</title>


</head>
<body class="sapUiBody" id="content"></body>
</html>
```

:point_right: Restart the service (with `cds serve all`) and go to the URL [http://localhost:4004/webapp](http://localhost:4004/webapp). Here, you are not shown the "Welcome to cds.services" landing page - instead, the page is empty, except for the page title in the browser tab, that shows us that the HTML we entered has been loaded:

![title in browser tab](title-in-browser-tab.png)


### 2. Add a new module to the project descriptor

This new `app/` directory contains all UI files and represents a new module in the context of what we're eventually going to deploy to the SAP Cloud Platform. 

For this to work and be included in what we eventually deploy and run, we must add information to the main deployment descriptor file `mta.yaml` that holds information relating to this.

:point_right: Replace the content of your `mta.yaml` file with the following lines. (Basically only the `bookshop-ui` module was added, but the formatting of `yaml` files is very unforgiving, so just copy / paste the entire content from here and replace everything, to keep things simple!)
```
_schema-version: 2.0.0
ID: bookshop
version: 1.0.0
modules:
  - name: bookshop-db
    type: hdb
    path: db
    parameters:
      memory: 256M
      disk-quota: 256M
    requires:
      - name: bookshop-db-hdi-container
  - name: bookshop-srv
    type: nodejs
    path: srv
    parameters:
      memory: 512M
      disk-quota: 256M
    provides:
      - name: srv_api
        properties:
          url: ${default-url}
    requires:
      - name: bookshop-db-hdi-container
  - name: bookshop-ui
    type: nodejs
    path: app
    parameters:
      memory: 256M
      disk-quota: 256M
    requires:
      - name: srv_api
        group: destinations
        properties: 
          forwardAuthToken: true
          strictSSL: true
          name: srv_api
          url: ~{url}
resources:
  - name: bookshop-db-hdi-container
    type: com.sap.xs.hdi-container
    properties:
      hdi-container-name: ${service-name}
    parameters:
      service: hanatrial

```

This snippet not only describes the runtime environment of the new module, it also injects the URL of the deployed `srv` module during deploy time.

_Note: If you want to run the application in non-trial environment, use `service: hana` instead of `service: hana`.



### 3. Add a Fiori sandbox environment to the UI index page

Let's now get back to the HTML in the `index.html` file. To create a sandbox Fiori launchpad we'll need the UI5 runtime as well as artefacts from the `test-resources` area of the toolkit.

:point_right: Add these `script` elements between the `title` element and the end of the `head` element in `index.html`:

```html
    <script>
        window['sap-ushell-config'] = {
            defaultRenderer: 'fiori2',
            applications: {
            }
        };
    </script>

    <script
        src="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/ushell/bootstrap/sandbox.js"></script>

    <script id="sap-ui-bootstrap"
        src="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/resources/sap-ui-core.js"
    		data-sap-ui-libs="sap.m,sap.ushell,sap.collaboration,sap.ui.layout"
    		data-sap-ui-compatVersion="edge"
    		data-sap-ui-theme="sap_fiori_3"
    		data-sap-ui-resourceroots='{"bookshop": "../"}'
        data-sap-ui-frameOptions="allow"></script>

    <script>
        sap.ui.getCore().attachInit(
            () => sap.ushell.Container.createRenderer().placeAt('content')
        )
    </script>
```

Here's a brief summary of what each of these `script` elements are for, in order of appearance in the file:

1. Basic configuration for the Fiori launchpad sandbox (otherwise known as the "universal shell" or "ushell")
1. Loading of the actual Fiori launchpad sandbox itself
1. Loading and bootstrapping of SAPUI5
1. Some JavaScript to declare a function to run when the initialization of SAPUI5 is complete; the function creates a launchpad and places it into the Document Object Model

Reloading the browser tab should now show the beginnings of something recognizable as a Fiori launchpad:

![an empty Fiori launchpad](empty-fiori-launchpad.png)


### 4. Introduce a basic UI app to the Fiori launchpad

Now we have the launchpad as a container for our app, let's introduce it gradually.

The first thing to do is to add an entry to the sandbox launchpad configuration to define a tile and the app to which it should be connected.

:point_right: Do this by adding this "browse-books" section to the `applications` property in the "sap-ushell-config" - remember that this is inside the first `script` element in the file (context is shown):

```javascript
<script>
    window['sap-ushell-config'] = {
        defaultRenderer: 'fiori2',
        applications: {
            'browse-books': {                                        // <--
                title: 'Browse Books',                               // <--
                description: 'Bookshop',                             // <--
                additionalInformation: 'SAPUI5.Component=bookshop',  // <--
                applicationType : 'URL',                             // <--
                url: '/webapp'                                       // <--
            }                                                        // <--
        }
    };
</script>
```

Reloading the index page in the browser should show this:

### 5. Create the app artefacts

As we can see from the configuration we've just added, we're suggesting the app is a Component-based app (where the component name is "bookshop") and is to be found at (relative) URL `/webapp`. Let's flesh that out in terms of directories and files now.



:point_right: In the new `webapp/` directory, create a simple `Component.js` file (note the capitalization of the filename) with the following content:

```js
sap.ui.define(
    ['sap/fe/AppComponent'],
    ac => ac.extend('bookshop.Component', {
        metadata: {
            manifest: 'json'
        }
    })
)
```

This is a modern UI5 component definition that points to a JSON configuration file (a manifest).

:point_right: Create the corresponding manifest file `manifest.json` in the same directory as `Component.js`, with the following content:

```json
{
    "_version": "1.8.0",
    "sap.app": {
        "id": "bookshop",
        "type": "application",
        "title": "Browse Books",

        }
    },

            },
            "": {
                "dataSource": "CatalogService",
                "settings": {
                    "synchronizationMode": "None",
                    "operationMode": "Server",
                    "autoExpandSelect": true,
                    "earlyRequests": true,
                    "groupProperties": {
                        "default": {
                            "submit": "Auto"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        "routing": {
            "routes": [{
                    "pattern": "",

                    "target": "BooksList"
                },
                {
                    "pattern": "Books({key})",
                    "name": "BooksDetails",
                    "target": "BooksDetails"
                }
            ],
            "targets": {
                "BooksList": {
                    "type": "Component",

                    "name": "sap.fe.templates.ListReport",
                    "options": {
                        "settings": {
                            "entitySet": "Books",
                            "navigation": {
                                "Books": {
                                    "detail": {
                                        "route": "BooksDetails"
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                },
                "BooksDetails": {
                    "type": "Component",
                    "id": "BooksDetails",
                    "name": "sap.fe.templates.ObjectPage",
                    "options": {
                        "settings": {
                            "entitySet": "Books"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

### 6. Create a CDS index file

This is the point where you can introduce an `index.cds` file which controls which services are exposed.

:point_right: Create a file `index.cds` in the `srv/` directory, and add the following single line as the initial content:

```cds
using from './cat-service';
```

_Note: At this point you can actually reload the UI; while you will see some semblance of an app when you select the tile in the launchpad, the app's display will be mostly empty._


### 7. Add annotations for the service

Now let's look at important content that will help us join together in our minds the two complementary worlds of CAP and Fiori. This content is to be added to `index.cds` and controls what gets served to Fiori frontends, via annotations that form a rich layer of metadata over the top of the service.

:point_right: Below the initial line (`using from ...`) that you added to `index.cds` in the previous step, add the following content:

```cds
annotate CatalogService.Books with @(
    UI: {
        Identification: [ {Value: title} ],
        SelectionFields: [ title ],
        LineItem: [
            {Value: ID},
            {Value: title},
            {Value: author.name},
            {Value: author_ID},
            {Value: stock}
        ],
        HeaderInfo: {
            TypeName: '{i18n>Book}',
            TypeNamePlural: '{i18n>Books}',
            Title: {Value: title},
            Description: {Value: author.name}
        }
    }
);

annotate CatalogService.Books with {
    ID @title:'{i18n>ID}' @UI.HiddenFilter;
    title @title:'{i18n>Title}';
    author @title:'{i18n>AuthorID}';
    stock @title:'{i18n>Stock}';
}

annotate CatalogService.Authors with {
    ID @title:'{i18n>ID}' @UI.HiddenFilter;
    name @title:'{i18n>AuthorName}';
}
```

_Note: You may see some warnings that there are no texts for the internationalization (i18n) identifiers. We'll fix this shortly, you can ignore the warnings for now._

The final thing to do in this step is to redeploy because we have added CDS artefacts.

:point_right: Do this now, with `cds deploy --to sqlite:bookshop.db`, before restarting the service with `cds serve all`.


### 8. Test the app

The app should be ready to invoke. Reload the Fiori launchpad and select the tile. It should open up into a nice List Report style Fiori Elements app - all driven from the service's annotations:

![the Browse Books app](browse-books-app.png)

Well done!


### 9. Add base internationalization texts

Just to round things off, add some i18n texts - they're referred to in various annotation sections, and it will make the app look a little more polished.

:point_right: Create a directory called `i18n/` as a direct child of the `srv/` directory, and create a file `i18n.properties` inside it, with the following content:
```
ID=ID
Title=Title
Stock=Stock Available
AuthorID=Author ID
AuthorName=Author Name
Book=Book
Books=Books
```

:point_right: Redeploy and restart the service (`cds deploy --to sqlite:bookshop.db && cds serve all`) and reload the app. You should see the static texts as specified in the `i18n.properties` file, such as "Author Name" rather than "AuthorName".


## Summary

While this was a little intense as far as creation of artefacts was concerned, we hope you agree that for little effort, and based on a great foundation, a lot can be achieved!

## Questions

1. Why do we put the internationalization file in the `srv/` directory (rather than the `app/` directory)?

1. Which variable have you accessed in the `mta.yaml` descriptor and where has it been defined?
