# Prerequisites

There are hardware and software prerequisites for participating in this CodeJam. There are also some optional, recommended items that you might like to have too. **Administration rights are an essential requirement due to the installation of some local tools**. 

## Hardware

Each participant should have their own laptop with enough admin privileges to be able to install software. You should also be able to access a command line shell (e.g. `cmd.exe` on Windows). The laptop should also be able to connect to the host organization's guest network for Internet access, and have enough power for the whole day.

## SAP Cloud Platform

Each attendee should have an SAP Cloud Platform trial account, and specifically a Cloud Foundry environment with an organization and a space defined. See the following tutorials for more details:

- [Get a Free Trial Account on SAP Cloud Platform](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html)
- [Create a Cloud Foundry Account](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-cf-create-account.html)
- [Log in via the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-cf-download-cli.html)

## Software

There are some mandatory and optional requirements with respect to software.

### Mandatory

Before the CodeJam day, participants must ensure they have the following installed on their laptops:

- Chrome (latest version): <https://www.google.com/chrome/>
- Visual Studio Code (also known as VS Code): <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>
- Node.js (latest LTS version 10): <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>
- Postman : <https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/>
- The Cloud Foundry command line tool: <https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.46.1>
- The Multi-Target Application Cloud Foundry CLI Plugin (CF MTA Plugin): 
    ```bash
    cf add-plugin-repo CF-Community https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org
    cf install-plugin multiapps
    ```
    (Details: <https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/multiapps-cli-plugin>)
- Make : <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>
- SQLite : <https://sqlite.org/index.html>
- Windows Build Tools (for Windows User only): 
    ```bash
    npm install -g windows-build-tools@4.0.0
    ````

_Note: If you're running Windows, it's likely that you won't have `SQLite` or `make` installed. In this case, we recommend that you use the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager to install both ([SQLite](https://chocolatey.org/packages/sqlite) and [make](https://chocolatey.org/packages/make)) - see below._

Once you're done installing, please ensure you can successfully start the executables `sqlite3`, `make`, `cf` and `node` from the command line, and check that you can successfully install packages with the `npm` command that also gets installed with Node.js.

#### Installing SQLite and make on Windows

Use the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager:

1. Install Chocolatey by executing this as admin:

  ```bash
  @"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"
  ```

2. Now use Chocolatey to install SQLite and then make:
  ```bash
  choco install sqlite
  choco install make
  ```

### Optional

Some of the exercises require you to make HTTP requests, and for this you can use Postman (a mandatory software requirement above). Alternatively you can also use cURL, a command line HTTP client. Instructions for the HTTP requests in each exercise are given for both Postman and cURL. So you may want to install cURL; you can do so by visiting [https://curl.haxx.se/](https://curl.haxx.se/).


Further to the software prerequisites described above, we also recommend:

- The [JSON Formatter extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en) for Google Chrome
- The [XML Tree extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xml-tree/gbammbheopgpmaagmckhpjbfgdfkpadb) for Google Chrome


## Attendees

Some familiarity with JavaScript is strongly recommended. Existing familiarity with Core Data Services (CDS) concepts is an advantage, as is experience with working with command line tools.

Attendees wishing to prepare themselves for the day can take advantage of the tutorial [Create a Basic Node.js App](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-node-create-basic-app.html) in the SAP Developer Center.
